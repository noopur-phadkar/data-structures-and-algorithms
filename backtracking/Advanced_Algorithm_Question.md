### Advanced Sudoku Solver (Constraint Propagation with Backtracking)

#### Overview:
In this advanced version of the Sudoku solver, we will enhance the basic backtracking algorithm by incorporating constraint propagation techniques. This approach reduces the search space significantly, making the solver more efficient, especially for complex puzzles.

#### Advanced Techniques:
1. **Constraint Propagation:**
   - Before placing a number, we will eliminate choices that are not possible based on Sudoku rules.
   - Use the "naked single" technique, where a cell has only one possible number, and "hidden single" technique, where a number can only go into one cell within a row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.

2. **Heuristic Improvements:**
   - Use a more strategic approach to selecting the next cell to fill. For example, choose the cell with the fewest possible candidates.

3. **Combination of Techniques:**
   - Combine constraint propagation with backtracking for an optimized solution.

#### Advanced Algorithm:
1. **Constraint Propagation:**
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of possible candidates for each empty cell.
   - Implement functions to eliminate candidates based on Sudoku rules.

2. **Heuristic for Cell Selection:**
   - Use the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic to select the next cell with the fewest candidates.

3. **Backtracking with Constraint Propagation:**
   - Integrate constraint propagation into the backtracking algorithm.

### Advanced Question:
1. **Heuristic Improvement:**
   - Modify the algorithm to select the cell with the fewest candidates (Minimum Remaining Values - MRV) for the next placement.

2. **Constraint Propagation:**
   - Enhance the constraint propagation function to handle more complex techniques like "hidden pairs" and "pointing pairs."

3. **Optimization:**
   - Further optimize the solver by implementing additional techniques like "naked triples" and "X-Wing."

#### Challenge:
- Implement and integrate these advanced techniques into the solver.
- Test the solver on a variety of difficult Sudoku puzzles to evaluate its performance and efficiency.

Good luck, and enjoy tackling this advanced Sudoku solver!
