# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental for every programmer and software engineer. This repository serves as a collection of code examples, explanations, and exercises related to data structures and algorithms.

The implementations are organized into different directories based on categories such as sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, data structures, etc. Each directory contains one or more Python files implementing specific algorithms or data structures along with explanations and comments within the code.

## Categories

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementations of searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

## Practice Only

This repository is intended for practice purposes only. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different implementations, and use it as a learning resource.
